This will walk you through installing HuskSync on your network of Spigot servers.

## Requirements
> **Note:** If the plugin fails to load, please check that you are not running an [incompatible version combination](Unsupported-Versions)

* A MySQL Database (v8.0+)
* A Redis Database (v5.0+) &mdash; see [[FAQs]] for more details.
* Any number of Spigot servers, connected by a BungeeCord or Velocity-based proxy (Minecraft v1.17.1+, running Java 17+)

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Install the jar
- Place the plugin jar file in the `/plugins/` directory of each Spigot server.
- You do not need to install HuskSync as a proxy plugin.
### 2. Restart servers
- Start, then stop every server to let HuskSync generate the [[config file]].
- HuskSync will throw an error in the console and disable itself as it is unable to connect to the database. You haven't set the credentials yet, so this is expected.
- Advanced users: If you'd prefer, you can just create one config.yml file and create symbolic links in each `/plugins/HuskSync/` folder to it to make updating it easier.
### 3. Enter MySQL & Redis database credentials
- Navigate to the HuskSync config file on each server (`~/plugins/HuskSync/config.yml`)
- Under `credentials` in the `database` section, enter the credentials of your MySQL Database. You shouldn't touch the `connection_pool` properties.
- Under `credentials` in the `redis` section, enter the credentials of your Redis Database. If your Redis server doesn't have a password, leave the password blank as it is.
- Unless you want to have multiple clusters of servers within your network, each with separate user data, you should not change the value of `cluster_id`.
### 4. Set server names in server.yml files
- Navigate to the HuskSync server name file on each server (`~/plugins/HuskSync/server.yml`)
- Set the `name:` of the server in this file to the ID of this server as defined in the config of your proxy (e.g., if this is the "hub" server you access with `/server hub`, put `'hub'` here)
### 5. Start every server again
- Provided your MySQL and Redis credentials were correct, synchronization should begin as soon as you start your servers again.
- If you need to import data from HuskSync v1.x or MySQLPlayerDataBridge, please see the guides below:
