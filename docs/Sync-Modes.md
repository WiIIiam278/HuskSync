HuskSync offers two built-in **synchronization modes** that utilise Redis and MySQL to optimally sync data as users change servers (illustrated below). These sync modes change the way data is synced between servers, and can be changed in the `config.yml` file.

![Overall architecture of the synchronisation systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiIIiam278/HuskSync/master/images/system-diagram.png)

## Available Modes
* The `DELAY` sync mode is the default sync mode, that use the `network_latency_miliseconds` value to apply a delay before listening to Redis data
* The `LOCKSTEP` sync mode uses a data checkout system to ensure that all servers are in sync regardless of network latency or tick rate fluctuations. This mode was introduced in HuskSync v3.1

You can change which sync mode you are using by editing the `sync_mode` setting under `synchronization` in `config.yml`. 

> **Warning:** Please note that you must use the same sync mode on all servers (at least within a cluster).

```yaml
synchronization:
  # The mode of data synchronization to use (DELAY or LOCKSTEP). DELAY should be fine for most networks. Docs: https://william278.net/docs/husksync/sync-modes
  mode: DELAY
```
</details>

## Delay
The `DELAY` sync mode works as described below:
* When a user disconnects from a server, a `SERVER_SWITCH` key is immediately set on Redis, followed by a `DATA_UPDATE` key which contains the user's packed and serialized Data Snapshot.
* When the user connects to a server, they are marked as locked (unable to break blocks, use containers, etc.)
* The server asynchronously waits for the `network_latency_miliseconds` value (default: 500ms) to allow the source server time to serialize & set their key.
* After waiting, the server checks for the `SERVER_SWITCH` key. 
  * If present, it will continuously attempt to read for a `DATA_UPDATE` key; when read, their data will be set from the snapshot deserialized from Redis.
  * If not present, their data will be pulled from the database (as though they joined the network)

`DELAY` has been the default sync mode since HuskSync v2.0. In HuskSync v3.1, `LOCKSTEP` was introduced. Since the delay mode has been tested and deployed for the longest, it is still the default, though note this may change in the future.

However, if your network has a fluctuating tick rate or significant latency (especially if you have servers on different hardware/locations), you may wish to use `LOCKSTEP` instead for a more reliable sync system.

## Lockstep
The `LOCKSTEP` sync mode works as described below:
* When a user connects to a server, the server will continuously asynchronously check if a `DATA_CHECKOUT` key is present. 
  * If, or when, the key is not present, the plugin will set a new `DATA_CHECKOUT` key.
* After this, the plugin will check Redis for the presence of a `DATA_UPDATE` key. 
  * If a `DATA_UPDATE` key is present, the user's data will be set from the snapshot deserialized from Redis contained within that key.
  * Otherwise, their data will be pulled from the database.
* When a user disconnects from a server, their data is serialized and set to Redis with a `DATA_UPDATE` key. After this key has been set, the user's current `DATA_CHECKOUT` key will be removed from Redis.

Additionally, note that `DATA_CHECKOUT` keys are set with the server ID of the server which "checked out" the data (taken from the `server.yml` config file). On both shutdown and startup, the plugin will clear all `DATA_CHECKOUT` keys for the current server ID (to prevent stale keys in the event of a server crash for instance)
