**HuskSync** is a modern, cross-server player data synchronization system that enables the comprehensive synchronization of your user's data across multiple proxied servers. It does this by making use of Redis and MySQL to optimally cache data while players change servers.

## Features
**⭐ Seamless synchronization** &mdash; Utilises optimised Redis caching when players change server to sync player data super quickly for a seamless experience.

**⭐ Complete player synchronization** &mdash; Sync inventories, Ender Chests, health, hunger, effects, advancements, statistics, locked maps & [more](https://william278.net/docs/husksync/sync-features)—no data left behind!

**⭐ Backup, restore & rotate** &mdash; Something gone wrong? Restore players back to a previous data state. Rotate and manage data snapshots in-game!

**⭐ Import existing data** &mdash; Import your MySQLPlayerDataBridge data—or from your existing world data! No server reset needed!

**⭐ Works great with Plan** &mdash; Stay in touch with your community through HuskSync analytics on your Plan web panel.

**⭐ Extensible API & open-source** &mdash; Need more? Extend the plugin with the Developer API. Or, submit a pull request through our code bounty system!

**Ready?** [It's syncing time!](https://william278.net/docs/husksync/setup)

## Setup
Requires a MySQL (v8.0+) database, a Redis (v5.0+) server and any number of Spigot-based 1.16.5+ Minecraft servers, running Java 16+.

1. Place the plugin jar file in the /plugins/ directory of each Spigot server. You do not need to install HuskSync as a proxy plugin.
2. Start, then stop every server to let HuskSync generate the config file.
3. Navigate to the HuskSync config file on each server (~/plugins/HuskSync/config.yml) and fill in both the MySQL and Redis database credentials.
4. Start every server again and synchronization will begin.

## Development
To build HuskSync, simply run the following in the root of the repository:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
